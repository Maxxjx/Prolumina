## Developer Setup & Deployment Guides

### Local Development Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env.local` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=your_dev_url
   USE_PRISMA=true
   ENABLE_REALTIME=false
   ```
4. Run database migrations (if using Prisma): `npx prisma migrate dev`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Deployment
- CI/CD: Configure GitHub Actions to run tests and deploy on Vercel.
- Environment-specific configurations are set via Vercel’s dashboard.
- Ensure USE_PRISMA is set to 'true' when migrating from mock data to a live database.

## API Endpoints & Real-Time Features

- Authentication: /api/auth
- Projects: /api/projects
- Tasks: /api/tasks
- Analytics: /api/analytics
- Users: /api/users

### Feature Flags
Set the following environment variables to control features:
- USE_PRISMA: Switch between mock data and Prisma for the database.
- ENABLE_REALTIME: Enable real-time updates via Socket.IO.

### Feature Rollout Strategy
Features are released incrementally. Initial beta testing with the feature flags enabled guides the final roll-out, ensuring stability and gathering user feedback before full-scale deployment.

## Future Enhancements

- **Full API Integration:** Transition from mock services to live database operations using Prisma.
- **Real-Time Data & Analytics:** Implement dynamic charts and reporting features.
- **Enhanced Authentication:** Include password recovery and advanced security features.
- **UI Component Library:** Further modularization of the UI using Shadcn/ui components.
- **Documentation & Testing:** Expand documentation with architecture diagrams and further increase test coverage.
